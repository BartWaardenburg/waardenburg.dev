## Sections

### 1. Hero

**Name:** Bart Waardenburg
**Role:** Freelance Full-Stack Developer & Tech Lead
**Location:** The Hague area, Netherlands

**Tagline ideas** (pick/refine one):
- "Building fast, accessible web experiences"
- "Front-end developer with an eye for design"
- "I help teams ship better products, faster"

**CTA:** "See my work" / "Let's chat"

---

### 2. About

**Angle:** Not a CV. Your story, your approach, what makes working with you different.

**Key themes to weave in:**
- Communication and Multimedia Design background — you bridge design and code
- Full-stack capable: front-end expert, but also headless CMS (Sanity, Contentful, Bloomreach, Statamic) and API work
- Flexible role: tech lead, full-stack dev, or front-end specialist depending on what the project needs
- Experience leading teams (up to 40 developers at ANWB)
- You care about user experience, not just code
- You keep up with cutting-edge tech but pragmatically

**Personal touches to consider:**
- Building Leveret in spare time (shows passion, entrepreneurial side)
- Based in The Hague / Rijswijk area
- Something about your working style? (collaborative, clear communication, etc.)

**Draft direction:**
> I'm a full-stack developer based in The Hague with a background in Communication and Multimedia Design. Depending on the project, I'm hands-on with code, leading a team, or both.
>
> Over the past 15+ years, I've worked with agencies, government organizations, and cultural institutions — building everything from component libraries to headless CMS integrations to APIs. At ANWB, I led a front-end team of 40 developers. These days my work varies: sometimes I'm the tech lead, sometimes I'm deep in the codebase, often a mix.
>
> Front-end is where I'm most at home. But I've learned that good software comes from understanding the full picture — the back-end, the content model, the people using it.
>
> When I'm not on client work, I'm building Leveret — a running app for trail and mountain athletes. Always happy to chat.
